This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this project, the user enters a note that is added to the list and stacked in a cookie so the navigator keeps it so if the user reloads the web page, the notes he entered before are still there. There's also a button to delete the list and the cookie.

This project was created to learnt how to test a react project with Enzyme and Jest.
